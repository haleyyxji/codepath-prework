App Idea:
I want to build an app that is like a combination of Instagram and Pinterest for the crochet/kintting community. I want to implement features like saving posts into a collection, forum posts, direct messages/groupchats, and explore feature to find inspiration or tutorials. I want it to be a modern and intuitive app that has everything you need to either start on your crafting journey, or enhance your skills. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
